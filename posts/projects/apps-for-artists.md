An iOS app designed to showcase the work of DJCAD fine art student
Mariella Verkerk. Using her work to brand the app, we designed, tested
and prototyped a gallery of work and a biography, and used
[openFrameworks][1] and [ofxQCAR][2] to create an augmented reality section where work
conceived as street art could be projected onto commonplace features.

We built a storyboard-based prototype which we used for initial testing,
then went through a number of iterations of the home screen design in
particular to make it more intuitive.

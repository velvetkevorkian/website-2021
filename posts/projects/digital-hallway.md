![Digital Hallway website](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8100/8597338621_ff8484d1e2_b.jpg)A small site for the joint Product/Interaction Design exhibition held at
DJCAD in January 2013. The site takes its cues from the presentation of
the exhibition itself. Each project belongs to one of two themes, one
with blue and one with brown wallpaper as an accent.

I implemented the site based on designs by [Tom Kinnear][1]. Tom’s original Photoshop comps are below, although we
reworked and simplified the structure of the site from what was
originally proposed.

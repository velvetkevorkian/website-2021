Inspired by the amazing sunsets we could see over the River Tay from our
studio, [Tom Kinnear][1] began encouraging people in
Dundee to post their photos tagged with #DundeeSunset and it quickly
took off. I put this page together to collate all the photos in one
place. It was even covered by STV’s Dundee news page.

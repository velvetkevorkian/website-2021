I spent three months over summer 2013 developing Telefónica UK/O2’s 2012
Sustainability Report. The team at Telefónica asked their brand
guardians at Lambie-Nairn to recruit a pair of interns to build the
report as an entirely digital project. I was selected as the front-end
developer while Patricia Lefebure was responsible for the visual design.

We spent some time initially getting to know the report, working out an
information architecture that would work with the amount of material
(over 20,000 words), generating concepts for the visual design, and
prototyping some of the interactive parts, which we then presented to
the senior sustainability team at Telefónica. Once they approved it, I
began coding the templates while Patricia finalised the detailed
designs.

All the templates were fully responsive, which I had to adapt from the
desktop designs that Patricia provided. The complexity of the designs
made this quite a challenge. There were also some complicated animations
to get my teeth into: one of the centrepieces of the site is the 40
Commitments, complete with a vine growing down the page and elements
popping in as you scroll. Fortunately I was mentored by the experienced
developers from Lambie-Nairn’s digital partners at Morph London, who
also cast their pixel-perfect eyes over the templates for QA purposes.

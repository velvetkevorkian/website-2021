A full site build for [adventuregolf.com][1]. The CMS
is built on [Rails][2] and [Casein][3]{:
target="_blank"}, which lets them manage pages, job postings, FAQs the
cafe menu, etc.

support for multiple locations when they opened their second venue in
Manchester in 2018.

 ![Landing page showing both locations](/images/2.jpg) I also manage the VPS the site runs on, with [Capistrano][4]{:
target="_blank"} for deployment.

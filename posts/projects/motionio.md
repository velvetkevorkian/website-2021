![MotionIO: One Great
Image](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5200/14063845389_f79caa3510_b.jpg)MotionIO
is an interactive audio-visual experience for multiple people, intended
for installation in a public area. Using open web technologies,
participants use the motion of their mobile phones to control and
interact with an organic generative system and each other. In this
shared virtual environment, using a mobile device in public is
transformed from a private act into a social one, creating a playful
collaborative space where unique combinations of sound and light can
form.

This project was developed from January â€“ May 2014 as my final degree
honours project. It uses WebSockets to stream real time device
accelerometer/gyroscope data from the the HTML5 Device Orientation API
to a Processing application. Users can interact with a flocking system,
and MIDI data is generated from their input to control synthesisers. The
system uses a dedicated wi-fi router with a local DNS redirect to make
the experience of joining and using it as simple as possible.

This was the final project for my HND Computer Art and Design. The brief
was to create a \"digital artefact\" which was in some way related to
[St. Enoch Square][1]. I chose to look at the way
people move through the area and different ways of interpreting that. I
wrote a Processing program to identify the differences between frames of
a digital video, and experimented with different ways of showing that.
You can follow how this project developed, and check out the code used,
on my blog:

I was contacted in early 2013 by [Adam Makarenko][2]
who was interested in using the effect in a music video. I completely
rewrote the code for Processing 2.0, refactored the triangle effects
using ToxicLibs and added an interface. You can see the effect around
the 2:35 mark in the video for Royal Wood's *The Glory*.

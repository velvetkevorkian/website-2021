![Traffic State](/images/703701_4782908208911_1976289682_o_8597130439_o.jpg)Traffic State is a physical visualisation of traffic in New York City,
based on live data provided by the city’s transport authority. It is a
response to a brief called *21st Century Barometers* — physical devices
which live in a domestic environment and provide useful daily data from
the internet. The metal links hung below provide a mechanical graph of
the average traffic speed for the past few hours.

Working with a team of one other interaction designer and a product
designer, we prototyped a number of different versions, from cardboard
and string to the final version with laser-cut plywood. I developed a
simple Processing program to parse the data and send the average speed
to an Arduino inside the device, which updates regularly and powers the
servos.

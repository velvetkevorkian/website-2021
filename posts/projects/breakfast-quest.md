*Breakfast Quest* is a game I helped design in collaboration with a
group of other Interaction Design and Product Design students from
DJCAD. We used co-design techniques to work with pupils from Dundee
primary schools’ breakfast clubs to design active games to encourage
healthier eating and lisfestyle choices. We also worked with
representatives from Tayside NHS, Dundee City Council, the Home Grown
Cereals Association, and the Royal Highland Educational Trust Angus
Countryside Initiative, all of whom were stakeholders in the co-design
process.

*Breakfast Quest* was designed to be easily distributed online,
requiring only a printed copy of the board, a die and counters-
materials which most breakfast clubs have already. The rules are simple
and printed on the board, and the physical activities can be adjusted
depending on how much space the school has available. We tested the game
with pupils from Our Lady’s primary school and got some great feedback
from them, and the game was selected by the stakeholders as the best
response to the brief we were set.

We also designed a black and white version of the board so players can
customise their board.

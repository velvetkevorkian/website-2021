Here's some quick sound sketches I put together for our Conceptual
Sound unit, as early experiments. All were created using [Reaper][1], a fantastic DAW \[digital audio workstation\] program
available for a ridiculously low price and an insanely generous
unrestricted trial. I've not used that many DAWs recently but I find it
much more intuitive to use than Cubase. These pieces involve a lot of
routing audio and MIDI to different tracks, which Reaper makes
incredibly easy.

**1: VerdantScape**

This is based around a snippet of a sermon I found online- the full
version is over an hour long. The main voice track uses a MIDI trigger
to send a MIDI note to the synths, one of which has a built in sequencer
for the rhythmic pulses. The opening synth pulses are triggered in the
same way as the rest even when the vocals are faded out. Here's a
screen grab of the Reaper window showing the track layout, the routing
matrix and the effects windows for each track:

**2: Senseless Violence**

This one is based around a repeated loop of a man speaking with
additional sounds dropped on top. There's a sweeping filter on the
loop, and there are also a couple of instances of Reaper's bundled
Avocado glitch generator plugin, which is frankly awesome, and some
ping-pong delay to make it a bit more disorientating. Again, some synths
are triggered by a MIDI trigger on the glitch tracks. Here's a screen
grab:

**3: Crash**

Part of the brief for this unit is to use [the nine words mentioned in a
previous post][4] as inspiration for sound pieces. I
took this a bit literally and based this around a loop of a crash cymbal
which has been pitch shifted down and slowed down. Again, this triggers
some synths and feeds a glitch generator. Obligatory screenshot:

And there you have it. Please let me know your thoughts in the comments!

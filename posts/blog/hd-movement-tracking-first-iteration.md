I shot some updated footage at the right resolution for my St Enoch
project from two different points of view. In retrospect, shooting at
1920x1080 was probably excessive for my needs, and can cause extra
problems (e.g. I don't have a big enough monitor, resizing stuff on the
fly in Processing is non-trivial, and it takes longer to process), so
the results here are 1280x720. The ultimate goal is to make some large
(A1-ish) prints which will probably be from PDFs anyway.

The video shows a mixture of the Processing output and the original
footage. When working in Processing this doesn't play in real time
(more like 1-2 fps) and it seems really busy played back at 25 fps. I
think I'll need to find a simpler visual solution for the final
results.

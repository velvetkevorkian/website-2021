Went out to grab some better footage for my [St Enoch Square
project](/blog/work-in-progress-tracking-movement-in-st-enoch-square/), but thanks to a hilarious(!) mix up with camera
resolutions didn't get quite what I was after. Tried some more
experiments with it anyway, since it has a more static background (and
is therefore easier to pick out movement against).

The weather was pretty changeable, and I like how you can see the
changes in the light looking almost like geological strata. update: I
sorted out the aspect ratio of the footage and edited out all the bits
where no-one but pigeons passes. Here's an updated image:

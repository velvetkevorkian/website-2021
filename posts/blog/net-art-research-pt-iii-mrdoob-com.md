This last site kind of bridges the gap between the two I looked at
previously: introducing [Mr Doob][1]. His speciality seems to be HTML5
madness and high end JavaScript, but there's some phenomenal stuff
here, some of which is really pushing the boundaries of what's possible
visually on the web while still maintaining something that people will
actually want to use.

[Harmony][2] is a procedural drawing tool which provides some
interesting drawing possibilities; [Google Sphere][3] and [Google
Gravity][4] reconfigure the world's most famous search engine (make
sure you actually try a search in both!). [Or So They Say][5] is just a
lovely ambient experience, but possibly the best known (although it's
not clear exactly what his role in it was) is [The Wilderness
Downtown][6] which is a music video for the band Arcade Fire. Built in
HTML5, it combines specially filmed footage with content from Google
Earth to make something a bit mental. I suspect we'll be seeing a lot
more of this sort of thing as HTML5 support gets better.

You may find a lot of these projects aren't compatible with all
browsers, especially the Google experiments. I recommend [SRWare
Iron][7], which is a version of Google's Chrome browser with all the
stuff that talks to Google secretly stripped out. Isn't open source
great?

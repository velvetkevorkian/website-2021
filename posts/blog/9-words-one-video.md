Following on from my recent [Nine Images
post](/blog/nine-words-nine-images/){: target="_blank"}, here\'s a video
equivalent. I spent a lot of time thinking up obscure ways to link the
nine words (ambiguity, ephemeral, loop, serendipity, utopia, crash,
condition, diaphanous, and sequential) with short videos. In the end I
decided to be pretty literal with my interpretation of the words and
instead to make the presentation of the videos more interesting by
combining them into one visual assault. The videos were filmed on a
Mini-DV camera in standard PAL definition, then captured in Premiere.
The videos were edited, resized and some have had the speed changed
before being exported as an .mp4 using the h.264 codec, which gives the
best balance between size and quality in my experience. It is meant to
be silent. Enjoy!

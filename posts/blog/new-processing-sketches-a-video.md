Hello, and a somewhat belated happy new year! I hope 2011 has been good
to you so far. I've been pretty busy both with official college work
and personal projects, and it's the latter I want to show today. I put
together a wee compilation of some of the sketches I've put together
recently as a \"showreel\" of sorts (with one eye on interviewing for
university in the immediate future). Some of these aren't really
suitable for web deployment, and doing it as video lets me crank up the
detail and quality. It also gives me the opportunity to make some metal
to go behind it.

You can play with some of the live sketches on OpenProcessing: [Mesh
Typography][1], [3D Mesh Typography][2], and [Kinetic Typography][3]. I
might talk about some of the sketches in a bit more detail in future, in
the meantime please get in touch if you have any questions or comments.
Credit where credit's due: as well as [Processing][4], these pieces use the [Geomerative][5], [Traer Physics][6] and [Mesh][7] libraries. I was inspired to make some music for it by
the amazing [Cloudkicker][8], so thanks to Jaime
([@speedyjx][9]) for flagging him up to me. Until
next time...

My [St Enoch Square Motion Tracking](/projects/motion-tracking) pieces remain one of the biggest projects I've worked
on, and I'm really pleased that an updated version has now been used in
the video for [Royal Wood's *The Glory*][1],
directed by Adam Makarenko.

You can see the effect in action around the 2:35 mark. Adam contacted me
a few months ago about using the program, and I made some updates to it,
adding things like a functioning interface(!) and support for different
image sizes(!!). I also refactored the Voronoi/Delaunay code to use
[ToxicLibs][2] which made it much more stable, and
updating it for Processing 2.0 made a big increase in speed. I'm hoping
to have an opportunity to develop it further at some point- using
shaders for some if the image processing should make it faster- and a
proper file loader and preset system would make it much more useable.

It's really great to see what someone with a bit more artistic vision
can do with tools that you've made, so thanks to Adam for the
opportunity and the great work.

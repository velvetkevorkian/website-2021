My [St Enoch Square Motion Tracking](/projects/motion-tracking){:
target="_blank"} pieces remain one of the biggest projects I\'ve worked
on, and I\'m really pleased that an updated version has now been used in
the video for [Royal Wood\'s *The Glory*][1]{: target="_blank"},
directed by Adam Makarenko.

You can see the effect in action around the 2:35 mark. Adam contacted me
a few months ago about using the program, and I made some updates to it,
adding things like a functioning interface(!) and support for different
image sizes(!!). I also refactored the Voronoi/Delaunay code to use
[ToxicLibs][2]{: target="_blank"} which made it much more stable, and
updating it for Processing 2.0 made a big increase in speed. I\'m hoping
to have an opportunity to develop it further at some point- using
shaders for some if the image processing should make it faster- and a
proper file loader and preset system would make it much more useable.

It\'s really great to see what someone with a bit more artistic vision
can do with tools that you\'ve made, so thanks to Adam for the
opportunity and the great work.

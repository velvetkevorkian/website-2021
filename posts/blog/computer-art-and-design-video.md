If you look back through the earlier posts on this blog you\'ll notice
that it originated as a way to show the coursework I was doing during my
HND Computer Art and Design course which I did before moving on to
[DJCAD][1] in Dundee. A few weeks ago I got invited
back to my *alma mater* to be interviewed for a film they were making to
attract people to the course. Here\'s the result, featuring a bunch of
very talented alumni, and me! There are also some snippets of my [graded
unit work](/projects/motion-tracking/) and my
[Processing showreel](/projects/showreel-2011/)
featured, which is nice. The students have put together a really nice
showcase for the course.

The main reason for writing this is to encourage anyone wondering
whether this course might be for them to go and check it out. When I
applied I had pretty much zero art and design experience, just a few
terrible renders I\'d made in 3ds Max and some horrendous sketching, but
David thankfully decided to take a chance on me, and within just a few
weeks he\'d [blown my mind with something][2] that\'s
radically changed my course for the better and opened up an enormous
number of potential doorways for me. I can\'t really thank David, Dianne
and Andy enough for all the help they gave us, and it looks like the
facilities they have access to are better than when I was there too.

Anyway, if you\'re interested in the course and want to talk about it
with someone who\'s done it (in a totally non-official capacity), I\'m
happy to oblige- that\'s the least I can do after all that I got out of
it. You can leave a comment here or go through my [contact page][3].

Here\'s the video:

I\'ll not mention the fact that they misspelt my surname though... wait,
what?

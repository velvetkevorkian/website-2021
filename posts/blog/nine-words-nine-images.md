Here are some images I created for a college assignment based on nine
words: ambiguity, diaphanous, condition, crash, ephemeral, loop,
sequential, serendipity and utopia. All were inspired by examples from
an archived Department of Transport book called \"Know Your Traffic
Signs\", and use a version of the Transport font from [CBRD.co.uk][1]. No, I didn't know there was a website dedicated to
cataloguing roads either.

I hit upon the idea of road signs while I was looking for a consistent
thread to tie these ideas together; the meanings of all nine words can
have so many interpretations I had to find some way to link each one
without being completely literal about it. The brief suggested that the
words were related to the artistic process; I guess you could see that
as a journey of sorts, and these are markers to guide your path. Maybe
it just appealed to my sense of humour. In any case, it is a strong and
recognisable visual identity; it's ubiquity (to people in the UK at
least) makes it ideal for a spot of pastiche.

From a technical standpoint, all the signs were copied from the book
into Photoshop where they were \"adapted\", then saved as GIFs: since
there are only a couple of colours in each it reduced the size of file
and visual artefacts compared with using JPEGs. I considered vectorising
them using Illustrator, but there didn't seem much point unless I need
them printed at a large scale.

[![ambigous1](/images/ambigous1_5015575253_o.gif)][2]

Ambiguity: Instructions which make no sense. Is one correct? Are
neither? Are both?

[![diaphanous1](/images/diaphanous1_5016151992_o.gif)][3]

Diaphanous: You can see through it, can't you?

[![condition1](/images/condition1_5015543465_o.gif)][4]

Condition: We are conditioned to a lot of strange things in this day and
age. Motorways are just one of those things.

[![crash1](/images/crash1_5016152136_o.gif)][5]

Crash: Could be handy to have a separate lane for accidents?

[![ephemeral1](/images/ephemeral1_5015543387_o.gif)][6]

Ephemeral: Here today, gone tomorrow...

[![loop1](/images/loop1_5016152038_o.gif)][7]

Loop: I'm not going to insult your intelligence by explaining this one.

[![sequential1](/images/sequential1_5016152090_o.gif)][8]

Sequential: A series of actions- no options here.

[![serendipity1](/images/serendipity1_5015543757_o.gif)][9]

Serendipity: A long and confusing route to an unlooked for happy ending.

[![utopia1](/images/utopia1_5015543713_o.gif)][10]

Utopia: Because obviously, any utopia will have boats. And trains.

Hopefully those will guide you on the roads. Safe journey!

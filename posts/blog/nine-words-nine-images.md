Here are some images I created for a college assignment based on nine
words: ambiguity, diaphanous, condition, crash, ephemeral, loop,
sequential, serendipity and utopia. All were inspired by examples from
an archived Department of Transport book called \"Know Your Traffic
Signs\", and use a version of the Transport font from [CBRD.co.uk][1]. No, I didn\'t know there was a website dedicated to
cataloguing roads either.

I hit upon the idea of road signs while I was looking for a consistent
thread to tie these ideas together; the meanings of all nine words can
have so many interpretations I had to find some way to link each one
without being completely literal about it. The brief suggested that the
words were related to the artistic process; I guess you could see that
as a journey of sorts, and these are markers to guide your path. Maybe
it just appealed to my sense of humour. In any case, it is a strong and
recognisable visual identity; it\'s ubiquity (to people in the UK at
least) makes it ideal for a spot of pastiche.

From a technical standpoint, all the signs were copied from the book
into Photoshop where they were \"adapted\", then saved as GIFs: since
there are only a couple of colours in each it reduced the size of file
and visual artefacts compared with using JPEGs. I considered vectorising
them using Illustrator, but there didn\'t seem much point unless I need
them printed at a large scale.

Ambiguity: Instructions which make no sense. Is one correct? Are
neither? Are both?

width="640" height="449"}][3]

Diaphanous: You can see through it, can\'t you?

[![condition1](https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4113/5015543465_f1c4c0e7f8_z.jpg){:
width="640" height="343"}][4]

Condition: We are conditioned to a lot of strange things in this day and
age. Motorways are just one of those things.

[![crash1](https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4151/5016152136_0092a8be6c_z.jpg){:
width="640" height="507"}][5]

Crash: Could be handy to have a separate lane for accidents?

[![ephemeral1](https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4130/5015543387_9ee7e9d7bb_z.jpg){:
width="640" height="346"}][6]

Ephemeral: Here today, gone tomorrow...

[![loop1](https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4149/5016152038_a633bfe5f8_z.jpg){:
width="640" height="379"}][7]

Loop: I\'m not going to insult your intelligence by explaining this one.

[![sequential1](https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4113/5016152090_9b8458e3b2_z.jpg){:
width="640" height="441"}][8]

Sequential: A series of actions- no options here.

[![serendipity1](https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4088/5015543757_b0e93fe61e_z.jpg){:
width="369" height="640"}][9]

Serendipity: A long and confusing route to an unlooked for happy ending.

[![utopia1](https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4127/5015543713_7cb701e1f9_z.jpg){:
width="578" height="640"}][10]

Utopia: Because obviously, any utopia will have boats. And trains.

Hopefully those will guide you on the roads. Safe journey!

Some further explorations in Perlin noise generated geometry: these
sketches are autonomous. The lines fade away slowly so the overall level
of complexity remains constant.

Here\'s some shots from the 2d version:

And just because I can, here\'s it in 3d:

To be honest the still images don\'t really do these sketches justice,
since the whole point is that they can go on without requiring
interaction. To get the full effect, you should check them out on
OpenProcessing: [the 2d version is here][5]{: target="_blank"} while the
[3d version can be seen here][6]{: target="_blank"}.

I have to say, in purely visual terms, the 2d version of this is my
favourite so far. Enjoy!

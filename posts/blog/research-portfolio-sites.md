As part of the Freelancing/Professional Skills units at college we have
to design a digital portfolio to promote one's self. Here are some
examples of sites that I like in this vein...

First up, [brendandawes.com][1], the online home of
Brendan Dawes. Brendan has been known as an early adopter who [pushed a
lot of boundaries using Flash][2], and has since
expanded into [general interaction design][3]. When I
first came across his work, it was on the previous incarnation of his
website- a Flash heavy design that was more interesting to play with
than useful for finding anything specific. This newer version is almost
the opposite. Using [Indexhibit][4], the layout is
super simple but totally intuitive. It is very easy to locate a specific
project, but also satisfying to browse around. There is no compulsion to
over-categorise, and the personal touches (the coloured headings, and
the background design on the homepage for example) are subtle enough to
perfectly offset the simplicity of the general layout.

Next up is [Michael Hansmeyer's site][6], showcasing
his work in generative architecture. There are a couple of nice touches
here; the switch to change the colour scheme is neat, and the layout is
crisp and modern. The categorisation of projects is OK, although the use
of a central panel for content is less than ideal for text, in my
opinion. It simply does not make best use of the available space. The
images, however, are stunningly presented and more than make up for any
other issues.

The last site I'm going to mention for now is the website of the (I
think) Russian photographer [Elena Savina][8]. This
was designed by [Three Hundred Eighty Ten][9] who I
[wrote about previously](/blog/net-art-research-pt-i-the389-com/), and
it shares the same... unconventional... approach to web design. This is
really easier to use than it is to explain, but essentially scrolling
one of the four panels scrolls the other three in different directions.
A nice touch is the lightbox style photo galleries which also use this
sliding idea. Quite bonkers, but unforgettable.

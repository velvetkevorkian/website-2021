[Complexification][1]{: target="_blank"} is a showcase for the works of
Jared Tarbell, and describes itself as a \"gallery of computation\"
filled with \"generative artefacts\". This site has some of the best
examples of generative art (mainly built with [Processing][2]{:
target="_blank"}) which is something I find totally fascinating, as you
may have guessed from some of [my previous
posts](/blog/variations-on-a-theme-processing-sketches/){:
target="_blank"}.

The works here aren\'t just technical exercises; despite being
essentially a collection of fairly advanced software, each of them has a
striking beauty about it, with a unified colour palette linking them
into a single body of work. They exhibit a wonderful sketchiness, and
sometimes a painterly quality. [Substrate][3]{: target="_blank"} is like
if [Mondrian][4]{: target="_blank"} used watercolours and smoked crack;
[Stitches][5]{: target="_blank"} evokes textures of woven cloth;
[Offspring][6]{: target="_blank"} visualises the family tree of a colony
of robots. Each of the pieces shown here is unique and fantastic, and
collectively form a benchmark against which a lot of generative art
today is measured against. For me, generative systems like the ones used
here provide the most exciting new paradigm for artists working in \"new
media\" (I hate that term).

If you\'re into this sort of thing its worth checking out[ Matt
Pearson\'s 100 Abandoned Artworks][7]{: target="_blank"} which has some
cool stuff in a similar, albeit less developed form. I was going to look
at it in a later post but it\'s a bit too similar to Complexification, I
think.

A couple of months ago me and <a href="https://www.orcfull.com/">Alistair</a> went to see the second part of [New
Designers 2013][1]. We visited the DJCAD Social
Digital (a combination of Digital Interaction Design and Product Design)
stand, congratulated the class of 2013 on their three award nominations
and two wins from over 1400 exhibitors, then we moved on to have a look
round the rest of the cavernous show floor. And that's when I started
getting irate.

quality of actual work on show was, for the most part, thoroughly
excellent. As we made our way through the show, though, we saw a few
mistakes in how people presented their work occur time after time -
mistakes that led to a lot of good work not being shown to best effect,
and mistakes that could and should have been avoided. Without further
ado…

## Don't make me work to find out what your design *is*

I'm going to give two specific examples: both notable for being good
ideas totally undersold.

1.  One of the first stalls we visited featured a chap who designed and
    built his own open-source Arduino-powered CNC router from commodity
    parts for under £500. It's an amazing piece of engineering
    ingenuity. Unfortunately, *nowhere* on the stand did it explain what
    the piece actually was. The guy had to come over and tell us what
    he'd made. There were some boards up with some overarching
    conceptual thinking about open source fabrication, but nothing about
    the specific items on display.
2.  Another guy had designed a triangular bottle for soft drinks. He had
    three A3 boards of ergonomic studies, fancy renderings with famous
    labels, diagrams showing how they would stack more easily than round
    bottles, etc. Unfortunately, it wasn't til halfway down the third
    board that he got to the actual point of the design: that they could
    be easily used for building houses in the global South rather than
    being recycled conventionally. Once again, the designer had to come
    and tell us about it.

Time after time, the [lede was buried][2] in pages of
impenetrable jargon. This was such a pattern that after the first few
stalls, I started skipping to the last paragraph of every text I read.
Depressingly enough, it worked.

Let me be blunt: if you have to come and explain your product to me, you
might as well not bother. If I have to read three pages of conceptual
justification before you get to the point, well, I'm probably not going
to. You want to grab someone's attention so that they know what you've
done, and they want to find out more, and *then* you can start on the
conceptual stuff. Do it the other way round, and 90% of people are going
to bounce straight off and move on to the Robocop-styled golf caddy at
the next stall; they might not give a shit about golf, but they can see
what it is and they don't have to read 500 words of art school nonsense
to get a better idea of it.

I guess this is a side effect of design and technology courses coming
out of art school environments, as opposed to engineering departments
(who I imagine would veer too far in the opposite direction), but this
is not your degree show, or your thesis defence. If there's one thing
I've learned from [Mike Monteiro][3], it's that
design is about selling your work- and yourself- to clients, to tutors,
or in this case, to New Designers attendees who may or may not want to
employ someone with your particular skill set. Do you really want to
lose that opportunity because you took too long to get to the fucking
point?

## Spell check your shit

In an age where almost every interaction with your phone, never mind
your computer, results in a squiggly red underline whenever you cock
something up, it is an unforgivable sin to have spelling mistakes in
your promotional material. First impressions count, and if the first
thing I notice is that you've fucked up something as basic as the
spelling on your pitch to the world, that doesn't exactly bode well.
Get someone else to look over it before printing it out. It's OK if
English isn't your first language- we should all be doing this. Offer
to read over your classmates' material. You're not being a dick by
pointing out mistakes, you're helping them make their work *better*.
Which means they're more likely to help make your work better.
Everybody wins.

## Design your presence

So what's to be done? Well, it's called New Designers for a reason.
Use the skills that are going to get you there on how you present
yourself and your work, as well as on the work itself. As designers we
solve problems and make peoples' lives easier: how can you make it
easier for people to understand what your showing them?

 ### Postscript

I don't think I have any special insight here, although as an
Interaction Design student I do think a lot about how people, uh,
interact with stuff. So maybe that helps. Regardless, the real reason
I've written this is to try and articulate the issues we came across,
so that we can do better next time.

Although the rage helped.

Anyway, I hope to be at New Designers 2014 as an exhibitor, so come and
hold my words against me. If you can't tell what I've designed within
twenty seconds, you can come and give me a good telling off. And if you
spot a typo in my blurb, well, I'll accept a swift kick to the shin.

Bring it on.

### Post-postscript

I wrote this post in the immediate aftermath of our visit, but haven't
gotten around to posting it until now for various reasons I won't bore
you with.

We had a meeting last week with our lecturer who said much the same
things, but slightly more politely, so I don't think I'm totally off
the rails with this. Feel free to comment or tweet me

*Pacific Rim* is a ridiculous movie about giant mind-controlled mechs
rocket-punching enormous [kaiju][1] from another world. It was directed
by Guillermo del Toro, and in the [director's commentary][2] he had this
to say:

> [Ishirō Honda][3], when he started Gojira, he said to his crew, he
> gathered everybody in the kitchen of his home and he said "listen
> guys, if anyone here doesn't believe we're doing a great movie, that
> we're making a great movie with a giant monster, please leave", and I
> demand of myself and my crew and my cast the same thing. We have to be
> unironic. We have to never be postmodern about these things we do.
> What you see is an exercise in faith and an exercise in law, and I
> deliver myself completely to every movie I do without a single shred
> of irony and I wanted my cast to feel that way because you can feel
> when people don't believe what they're doing. You can sense when
> people don't believe in that.

I was reminded of this by [this tweet][4] from noted metal blog
[Invisible Oranges][5], referring to the extraordinary [Slugdge][6]\:

> gastropod-themed progressive death metal band slugdge prove not only
> that the genre can be ridiculous and savage at the same time, but also
> that this synchrony makes the music *even better*

This, to me, is the essence of heavy metal. If you stop to think too
hard about e.g. men yelling about vikings over 200bpm blastbeats, the
whole thing falls apart, but bypass niceties like "good taste" and you
can feel the energy. (This is hardly unique to metal, as anyone who's
been reluctantly dragged to a club, only to find themselves lost to the
dancefloor might attest.) Cast aside your cynicism; be unironic and
un-postmodern, deliver yourself completely to the music, and you'll be
rewarded.

While I'm hesitant to make any grand statements about how films like
*Pacific Rim* and the best heavy metal qualify as art, they are
absolutely full of *craft*, and that craft shines through and connects
in the most visceral way.

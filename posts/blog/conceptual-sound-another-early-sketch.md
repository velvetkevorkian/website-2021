I wanted to do something with proper found sound, so I got all the
whirring bits of tech I could find and pointed a mic at them. As far as
I recall, there are three cameras, a printer and my laptop\'s DVD drive
whirring away. I also wanted to try something with some dynamics to it,
which was moderately successful. I quite like the driving rhythm,
anyway.

<span class="ql-cursor">ï»¿</span>Here's a quick snapshot of how this is
developing. This searches the [Guardian's Open Platform API][2] for mentions of everyone's favourite whistleblowing
website. The bars map the number of articles on a monthly basis, where
12 o'clock is January. You can see a small peak in April, when the
Collateral Murder video was released, bigger peaks in July and October
as the Afghanistan and Iraq logs are published and a massive spike in
December as \"Cablegate\" (oh, how I loathe the use of 'gate' as a
suffix for anything mildly controversial!) gets going. The article
headlines are arranged by date order, but on a uniform scale. This is
still work in progress, but I'm quite pleased with how it's shaping up
so far.

The first site I\'m going to bring to your attention as part of the
Advanced Software Applications research is [the389.com][1]. I was linked
to this site by someone on Twitter, but I\'m not sure who now- whoever
it was, thanks! The man behind it appears to be named Andrey Yazev, but
that\'s about all I can find, background wise.

The site hosts a variety of web art pieces and experiments. A lot of
them use [interface elements in imaginative ways][2]; some are [bonkers
physics based toys][3], while some[ shred your preconceptions ][4]of how
a website should operate. I particularly like [this wee sequencer][5]
which lets you create music on the fly.

This isn\'t so remarkable, you might think- tools like Flash and
Processing let you do this kind of thing relatively easily, but the fact
that this website has been built without using plugins or extensions at
all is pretty remarkable, although as HTML5 grows we\'ll no doubt see
further potential unlocked. This site does what web developers have been
doing for a long time: uses web technologies in new and unexpected ways.
It also has a certain nostalgic feel to it- a lot of the interface
elements used have a distinctly Web 1.0 look to them, but there is
clearly using some scary coding behind the scenes to create the somewhat
\"retro\" aesthetic.
